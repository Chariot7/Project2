# Wishpool
​
## Info:
​
##### This app was made to create a place for people to set their wishes or goals in the same place. It was intended to take the information and "charge" it in some way at the next full moon. So that there is an astrological event that is connected to the user wishes the same way someone might do if they went and visited  a witch.
